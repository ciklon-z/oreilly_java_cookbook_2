	<title>Ian Darwin's Java Cookbook Utilities</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Utility classes from <b>the second edition</b> of 
Ian Darwin's <i>Java Cookbook</i> (O'Reilly).
These classes implement many useful operations that one would normally
have to re-implement many times over.
</p>
<p>
Most of these appear in the first edition of the book, with different
package names and additional method signatures.
There have been many changes since then, including the split
into a half-dozen packages, with package names roughly parallel to those
of the standard API.
See the <a href="http://javacook.darwinsys.com/">Author's Book Site</a> and
the <a href="http://java.oreilly.com/catalog/javacook/">O'Reilly Site</a>
for more information on the book which accompanies this source code.
